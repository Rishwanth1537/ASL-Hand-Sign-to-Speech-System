🖐️ **ASL Hand Sign to Speech System**

An AI-powered pipeline that converts American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs into spoken English using:
MediaPipe (hand landmark detection)
TensorFlow (neural network classifier)
OpenAI LLM (sentence correction)
Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3)
This project focuses on landmark-based sign classification combined with LLM-based language refinement to generate natural spoken sentences.
